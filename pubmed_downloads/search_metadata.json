      "abstract": "The DNAJC protein family is a subclass of heat shock proteins that has attracted recent attention due to the identification of mutations that are linked with parkinsonism, a feature of Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. In this review, we discuss the current genetic and functional evidence of the association of these DNAJC proteins with disease and how mutations in these proteins may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Although DNAJC6 (Auxilin), DNAJC12, and DNAJC5 (CSP\u03b1) exhi...",

As co-chaperones of the master chaperone heat shock protein (HSP) 70, the HSP40 (DNAJ) proteins are largest chaperone family in eukaryotic cells. They contain a characteristic J-domain which mediates interaction with HSP70, thereby helping protein folding. It is well perceived that protein homeostasis i...",

Besides two common missense variants that did not show association with PD, the remaining missense variants were extremely rare (<0.5%), fo...",

Synapse maintenance is challenging given the long distances between the termini and the cell body, reliance on axonal transport for delivery of newly synthesized presynaptic proteins, and high rates of synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis. Hence, synapses rely on efficient proteostasis mechanisms to preserve their structure and function. To this end, the synaptic compartment has specifi...",
