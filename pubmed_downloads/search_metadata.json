Investigations of the diagnostic accuracy for the disease and other forms of parkinsonism in community-based samples of patients taking antiparkinsonian medication confirmed a diagnosis of parkinsonism in only 74% of patients and clinically probable Parkinson's disease in 53% of patients. Clinicopathological studies based on brain bank material from the UK and ...",

Most patients consult with their primary care physician about Parkinson disease symptoms before seeking care from a specialist. The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is clinical, and key disease features are bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The main diagnostic signs of Parkinson disease are motor symptoms; however, Parkinson disease is also associated with nonmotor symptoms, including autonomi...",

However, they are often under-recognized because the somatic symptoms of depression often overlap with the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease and there is low self-reporting. Clinicians need to be vigilant about early detection and treatment of anxiety and depression in the patient with Parkinson disease.
