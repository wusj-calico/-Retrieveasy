      "abstract": "Missense mutations in the human secretary carrier-associated membrane protein 5 (SCAMP5) cause a variety of neurological disorders including neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. We recently documented the importance of SCAMP2 in the regulation of T-type calcium channel expression in the plasma membrane. Here, we show that similar to SCAMP2, the co-expression of SCAMP5 in tsA-201 cells expressing recombinant Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>v</sub>3.3 chann...",

Therefore, their recruitment at the plasma membrane is critical in determining firing activity patterns of nerve cells.

The maintenance of nucleus pulposus (NP) cell and intervertebral disc integrity benefits largely from well-controlled mitochondrial quality, surveilled by mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) and mitophagy, but the outcome is cellular context-dependent that remain to be clarified.

The functionality of these replication organelles depends on the activities of both viral nonstructural proteins and co-opted host proteins.

To elucidate this mechanism, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) was used here as a virus model to investigate how thes...",

These tubules include the well-studied Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs), enriched in lysosomal membrane proteins. However, recent studies revealed that the Salmone...",

Mammalian genomes contain five SCAMP genes SCAMP1-SCAMP5 that regulate membrane dynamics, most prominently membrane-depolarization and Ca(2+)-induced regulated secretion, a key mechanism for neuronal and neuroendocrine signaling. However, the biological role of SCAMPs has remained poorly understood primarily owing to the lack of appropr...",
